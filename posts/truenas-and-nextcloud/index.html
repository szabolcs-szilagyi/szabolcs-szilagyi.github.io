    <p>Awhile back I wrote about my experience in running <a href="/posts/time-travel-and-privacy/">TrueNAS and Nextcloud</a> server
at home. Thought I would give a small update how is that after 1.5 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very happy with the whole setup, even extended storage in the server.
Had some interesting experiences when I tried to upgrade Plex and Nextcloud
jails. There I just gave up, I still update and upgrade them, but not via
TrueNAS&rsquo; update functionality, but by logging into the instance and issuing the
update commands in the container. Also before updating I always make backups of
them using the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/storage/snapshots/">snapshot feature</a> and when I managed to fubar my Nextcloud
instance it was just ~4 clicks to restore it to normal without losing data or
settings or anything. It is quite fiddly, still didn&rsquo;t manage to figure out how
am I going to upgrade the MySQL in that container. Tried to just use the
system&rsquo;s package manager, but that didn&rsquo;t turn out well.. So might gonna
re-create a new instance and just migrate settings and mounts over.</p>
<p>Managed to discover a <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/news">plugin</a> for Nextcloud recently that manages RSS feeds and
has also an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.luhmer.owncloudnewsreader">Android app</a>, so that it can keep track of read and unread news no
matter where the reading happened. Pretty much like feedly (used that service
before finding this), so I can read some articles on the computer and those will
be also marked as read on the mobile. Writing it down it feels like a laughable
feature, but its really convenient! (one less google owned service that I use)</p>
<p>My only grievance with Nextcloud is a <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/9981">regression in their mobile app</a> that they
are really slow on fixing it. The issue is about that once you sync photos from
Nextcloud to your phone, then the mobile&rsquo;s gallery app won&rsquo;t see them properly,
so you cannot use those photos in other apps. E.g. would like to crop and only
send the cropped image to someone on discord, well then you&rsquo;re out of luck..
have to edit it on the computer.. and since I&rsquo;m on the computer, might as well
send it from there.. Not a deal breaker bug, but it is annoying. Like this
Nextcloud for my wife is only about backup and easy access on the computer.</p>
<p>Over to backup feature of TrueNAS. Those files that are important to me and they
are not in Nextcloud (e.g. full family photo collection) I setup TrueNAS to do
daily cloud backups. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a> for it and like this I have an offsite
backup for ~7 USD/month for all those files that are truly important. Also
TrueNAS can do encrypted backups, so if the worst would happen and Backblaze
would get hacked, then still nobody would have to see pictures of me sipping
beer in my underwear. :D</p>
<p>So in this post I have mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nextcloud 11 times and</li>
<li>TrueNAS 7 number of times</li>
</ul>
<p>Safe to say that I&rsquo;m very happy with this setup and that I&rsquo;ve managed to
repurposed an old PC that wouldn&rsquo;t really get otherwise any use.</p>
