    <p>From time-to-time we encounter some legacy projects - or the braver developers
even work on them day after day. :) When working on such projects we do come
across the exclamation that: &ldquo;Starting from scratch would be quicker than trying
to fix this mess!&rdquo;. This normally comes from the frustration that legacy
projects can cause.</p>
<p>There are already lots of articles out on the interwebs about refactor vs
rewrite. Failure and success stories and would encourage those who don&rsquo;t have
experience in deciding this question to read many articles, pro and con. This
article includes a few good one:

<p>So where do I stand with this question? Personally I like to work on legacy
systems, one can feel like Indiana Jones exploring hidden gems, funny comments
and many odd solutions. Apart of this archaeological work when you just correct
a small bit on legacy code that can sometimes yield huge performance
improvements that makes work on them quite rewarding. So from this you can guess
that I&rsquo;m more towards the refactor end of the scope. In my experience rewrite
from scratch doesn&rsquo;t work on larger systems.</p>
<p>Got two rewrite stories to share. Long-long time ago I had the chance to partake
in a full rewrite of a large system that turned out to be the text book example
of the struggle and up hill battles. Second is a smaller project but was a good
reminder for me why I don&rsquo;t like rewrites.</p>
<h2 id="the-system">The System</h2>
<p>The system that I have had the chance to contribute in rewriting was like this:
had a legacy code base in python using Django with a MySQL database, then there
was a proof-of-concept app written next to it in NodeJS using MongoDB. This PoC
app supposed to be temporary. Yes, this is the point where you can already start
to laugh, like that ever happens&hellip; temporary&hellip;, of course it went to
production and the temp PoC solution hunted the company for 3+ years.</p>
<p>We tried to fix up the temp solution to get it into shape and avoid throwing
ever growing amount of money on CPU/memory/DB and network resources. But the
beast always managed to grow another head. This was the point where the lead at
that time decided to start over: clean slate.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lesson #1:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when you create a PoC or temp solution it still need to adhere to the
highest quality standards. In our case it was a rushed steaming pile of
spaghetti, straight from the stow.</p>
<h2 id="rewrite">Rewrite</h2>
<p>Now we have an instable PoC system in production and a stable but painfully slow
legacy system. How would you go about the rewrite? One could say divvy up the
system and start rewriting small portions of it. Yeah, one could definitely take
that path, but that wasn&rsquo;t the one we picked.</p>
<p>We started to create a parallel system from scratch dreamed up all the
microservices ahead of time. Decided to continue to use NodeJS with MongoDB as
that was already the hype back then. We created a synchronization service that
would actively bring data over from the old python system. The legacy and the
PoC was all used in production and we wanted to test early the new microservices
as well so we constantly synced data over to the system that nobody used yet.</p>
<p>The development teams were divided along the new and old systems. There was a
larger development team supporting the old system that was actively bringing in
money for the company and paying all of our salaries. Another smaller team had
the marvellous job of learning about new technologies and write the
microservices that will be the new system that will save us all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the chance to be in both of those parts (supporting the legacy and help
with the rewrite) actually neither side is fun. Supporting the old application
had the pressure from the clients that they needed newer and newer features,
hunting bugs, dealing with downtimes. Reward part here was that when you have
done something you got instant feedback on your job. In the rewrite team you get
the pressure that everybody is waiting for this saviour system to come. They
expect to get a system that will solve all their problems, it will solve their
insomnia, it saves their marriage, they will be better parents and the new
system will even make them coffee in the morning. Also there is more developers
on the old system cranking out newer and newer features that the new system of
course will support! :D</p>
<p>Catching the ever growing features of the system we would like to replace is
just like Don Quichotte fighting with the windmills. You have very small chance
of winning. We actually tried to push back on the adoption of the new system
saying that its just not yet ready. But eventually we all agreed that it will
never be fully ready and at one point we need to start using it.</p>
<h2 id="adaption-of-the-new-system">Adaption of the new system</h2>
<p>The whole team saw that we won&rsquo;t be able to reach feature parity. For the
adoption we pick a client that had the least need of custom features and set
them up with the new system.</p>
<p>There were a lot of hick-ups, we were correcting a lot of bugs and mistakes that
came from the fact that the new system was also rushed. It didn&rsquo;t become
spaghetti and thanks god we did write <em>some</em> tests - unlike the mentioned &ldquo;temp
PoC&rdquo; project that had zero tests. But eventually the new system was working, it
started to generate income for the company! To get to this point it took the
teams about 2 years!!! Also there was one big challenge still remaining: get all
the clients on it.</p>
<p>Migrating the clients was the next stage of the rewrite. Clients shouldn&rsquo;t need
to know about the changes we make in the background. They have a service that
they expect to get regardless if the backend is python or nodejs or assembly.
Interesting to note here that the service provided by the system relied on
historical data. That data was all in the old system! All that data had to be
converted and moved into the new system. This task was the one I actually ended
up enjoying maybe the most. Luckily the conversion wasn&rsquo;t too complex and it was
interesting to see that we filled up the new databases through weeks of
carefully controlled migrations. Had to be careful not to over load the old
system. Then after all that: it worked! The system manage to show the same
reports to the users just like the old system! 2-3 years and we managed to get
to the same point as where we were before! :D</p>
<h2 id="different-way">Different way</h2>
<p>The temp PoC system was some sort of microservices architecture, sometimes we
were joking about it saying its a micro-monolith as 4 services were serving it.
The python legacy system was monolith. New system with the planning up front
without good experience with microservices was more towards a distributed
monolith with ~8 services serving the flow. We managed to change on this over
time (without starting from scratch).</p>
<p>Thinking back of the decisions and what happened during the rewrite,
frustrations from both development and customer service teams, if I would have
to do the whole thing all over again, then would choose a different path.</p>
<p>Starting again with a monolith system would look at the processes and would try
to move out small parts of the big service to a new microservice. Breaking down
the monolith bit by bit, so that all parts are constantly in use and being
validated. When we were doing the rewrite and testing we didn&rsquo;t test the system
with high loads. Of course everything was working on low loads and amazing
developer computers, but when it went to production and came the load there were
lots of performance issues.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>In the above case rewrite was a bad decision in my opinion, but still we managed
to get it working. There are cases where you have no other choice than starting
from scratch. In another post I&rsquo;ll share a story where I did a full rewrite and
would do the same again in that situation.</p>
