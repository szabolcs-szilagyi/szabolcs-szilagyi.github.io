			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well hello there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is just another blog, that may or may not get forgotten over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests it will contain posts from this and that. Main topic will
always be IT related.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Szabolcs Szil√°gyi or Szabi (prn. Saby) for short. A software developer,
enjoying work with nodeJS to build performant microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 I&amp;rsquo;ve had the luck to join a french start-up company as a jnr.
JavaScript/nodejs programmer. It has been an intense start with the company, new
domain and technologies. But luckily I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed learning it all, so managed to
stick with them since then. As the company grown I also got the chance to grow
in both as a programmer and later as a lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a team lead for a relatively big team and numerous services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoy both participating and leading discussions about technical
challenges that our teams encounter. Like to discover both the hacky and the
idealistic solutions and their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart form work I really like to cycle and attend organized bike tours with my
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find up-to-date information about me, on my linkedin profile:
