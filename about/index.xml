			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well hello there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is just another blog, that may or may not get forgotten over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests it will contain posts from this and that. Main topic will
always be IT related.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Szabi (prn. ˈsɒbi) for short. A engineering manager and software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 I&amp;rsquo;ve had the luck to join a french start-up company as a jnr.
JavaScript/nodejs programmer. It has been an intense start with the company, new
domain and technologies. But luckily I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed learning it all, so managed to
stick with them since. As the company grown I also got the chance to grow in
both as a programmer and later as a lead, then engineering manager and now as a
director of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoy both participating and leading discussions about technical
challenges that our teams encounter. Like to discover both the hacky and the
idealistic solutions and their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from work I really like to cycle and attend organized bike tours with my
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find up-to-date information about me, on my linkedin profile:
