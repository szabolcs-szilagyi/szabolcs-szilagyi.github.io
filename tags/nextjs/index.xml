			<description>&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;rsquo;t take on extra work apart of my full time job. At work I do get to
try many different things. We get chance to work on both legacy and greenfield
projects. So really don&amp;rsquo;t feel that I would need extra projects on the side.. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project that I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write about is a webshop, that sort of fallen into
my lap. Back in 2010, when I started out with programming I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing
webhops and inventory sites, using PHP, MySQL. So it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel too alien to me
to help out every now and then, when the person running it needed help. Even
though I really don&amp;rsquo;t like webhops and always turned them away, this was the
first and last exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to be a second dev on this project as the original author had less and
less time to deal with it. Eventually the situation got to the point that I had
to take over the maintenance fully (to much of my dislike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state&#34;&gt;State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was written in PHP using MySQL and NextJS for the front-end. The
backend was producing normal JSONs, so nothing too exotic there. The issues
started when one started to look under the hood. The original author also didn&amp;rsquo;t
have much time to actually do the site and this was reflected in the code as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really chaotic and as I didn&amp;rsquo;t do programming in PHP for long it was hard
for me to change it in a good way. Since the site was simple there was no
framework used and as it was a rushed job the most common mistake was also made:
no tests were written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front-end was also similar, with the exception that there NextJS gave a nice
frame to it, but also zero tests to see if everything is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kickoff&#34;&gt;Kickoff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had to take over the maintenance including running the server, it was
clear that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to support the PHP backend specially in its current
form. Wanted to fix that up and stick with it, but really couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a handle
on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time I started to get to know NestJS as at my company we started to
migrate services to this framework. So for me it was an easy choice to go with
NestJS. The plan was to rewrite the backend using NestJS while keeping the
database schema and HTTP API the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I&amp;rsquo;ve made sure to do it in TDD, so that every new route and service
was fully tested. Some logic issues came out that were also present in the PHP
version. It was an interesting journey, but at times it did feel monotone, doing
the same over and over. But on the end all worked out and managed to deploy the
backend with nearly zero change to the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NestJS the default database ORM is TypeORM, it supports many different
databases. In general I don&amp;rsquo;t trust libraries that can do anything while
providing the same interface. But here it actually worked out nicely, as when I
was looking for database providers I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find cheap MySQL provider while I
managed to find a really cheap (actually free plan) for PostgreSQL. This was the
first time where I actually migrated from one database to a different one with
about 10 minutes job thanks to the ORM. I did concentrate on using the ORM&amp;rsquo;s
methods for building queries and had zero raw SQL statements in the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend&#34;&gt;Frontend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frontend wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the best of shape either, but hey it is React thanks to
NextJS, so that help a bit. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t in such a bad shape that I would want to
rewrite from scratch, but I needed some proof after each and every change that
all is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried to write tests using Jest, but the react part wasn&amp;rsquo;t written with the best
practices, so it brought out all timing issues. This way proved to be really
slow going. Here I decided to do an end-to-end testing using Cypress instead
unit and functional tests with Jest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had zero experience with Cypress, just seen some PRs and nice comments at work
from colleges. Before jumping into Cypress tests I crunched through a course
from udemy, with double playback speed, think it took me day and a half. Sorry,
don&amp;rsquo;t want to brag here but still makes me smile thinking about the instructor&amp;rsquo;s
voice in double speed :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this I covered all the pages and all the features that I came across. With
cypress it was truly a breeze, timing issues were still present, but manage do
put some &lt;code&gt;cy.wait&lt;/code&gt; commands and TODO comments for a later time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once cypress covered everything, refactoring the front-end and getting rid of
all the timing issues was a dream. Okay maybe not a dream, but went with good
speed and managed to do frequent deploys, knowing all is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outro&#34;&gt;Outro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;rsquo;m happy that I chose rewrite, with the old code without tests I would
still be having nightmares. Since then I managed to extend on the features of
the site and also automated a lot of tasks on it. All these new features were
done with tests, so at all time I know that the site is working and that the
person relying on it won&amp;rsquo;t lose sales due to bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this project gave me a good chance to deepen my knowledge with NestJS,
Cypress, React and NextJS. Did make me a fan of NestJS and NextJS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I did put a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of work into it. Looking back on it, eventually I
rewrote the front-end as well. Via refactors think there is no line that I
didn&amp;rsquo;t touch there. So in hind site for a webshop I would pick a provider rather
than hand rolling it.&lt;/p&gt;
