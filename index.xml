			<description>&lt;p&gt;Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Szabolcs Szilágyi or Szabi (prn. Saby) for short. A software developer,
enjoying work with nodeJS to build performant microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 I&amp;rsquo;ve had the luck to join a french start-up company as a jnr.
JavaScript/nodejs programmer. It has been an intense start with the company, new
domain and technologies. But luckily I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed learning it all, so managed to
stick with them since then. As the company grown I also got the chance to grow
in both as a programmer and later as a lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a team lead for a relatively big team and numerous services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoy both participating and leading discussions about technical
challenges that our teams encounter. Like to discover both the hacky and the
idealistic solutions and their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart form work I really like to cycle and attend organized bike tours with my
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find up-to-date information about me, on my linkedin profile:

			<title>Rewrite, refactor, knee-deep in legacy - part one</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;From time-to-time we encounter some legacy projects - or the braver developers
even work on them day after day. :) When working on such projects we do come
across the exclamation that: &amp;ldquo;Starting from scratch would be quicker than trying
to fix this mess!&amp;rdquo;. This normally comes from the frustration that legacy
projects can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already lots of articles out on the interwebs about refactor vs
rewrite. Failure and success stories and would encourage those who don&amp;rsquo;t have
experience in deciding this question to read many articles, pro and con. This
article includes a few good one:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22&#34;&gt;https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do I stand with this question? Personally I like to work on legacy
systems, one can feel like Indiana Jones exploring hidden gems, funny comments
and many odd solutions. Apart of this archaeological work when you just correct
a small bit on legacy code that can sometimes yield huge performance
improvements that makes work on them quite rewarding. So from this you can guess
that I&amp;rsquo;m more towards the refactor end of the scope. In my experience rewrite
from scratch doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on larger systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got two rewrite stories to share. Long-long time ago I had the chance to partake
in a full rewrite of a large system that turned out to be the text book example
of the struggle and up hill battles. Second is a smaller project but was a good
reminder for me why I don&amp;rsquo;t like rewrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-system&#34;&gt;The System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system that I have had the chance to contribute in rewriting was like this:
had a legacy code base in python using Django with a MySQL database, then there
was a proof-of-concept app written next to it in NodeJS using MongoDB. This PoC
app supposed to be temporary. Yes, this is the point where you can already start
to laugh, like that ever happens&amp;hellip; temporary&amp;hellip;, of course it went to
production and the temp PoC solution hunted the company for 3+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to fix up the temp solution to get it into shape and avoid throwing
ever growing amount of money on CPU/memory/DB and network resources. But the
beast always managed to grow another head. This was the point where the lead at
that time decided to start over: clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Lesson #1:&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; when you create a PoC or temp solution it still need to adhere to the
highest quality standards. In our case it was a rushed steaming pile of
spaghetti, straight from the stow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rewrite&#34;&gt;Rewrite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have an instable PoC system in production and a stable but painfully slow
legacy system. How would you go about the rewrite? One could say divvy up the
system and start rewriting small portions of it. Yeah, one could definitely take
that path, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the one we picked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started to create a parallel system from scratch dreamed up all the
microservices ahead of time. Decided to continue to use NodeJS with MongoDB as
that was already the hype back then. We created a synchronization service that
would actively bring data over from the old python system. The legacy and the
PoC was all used in production and we wanted to test early the new microservices
as well so we constantly synced data over to the system that nobody used yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development teams were divided along the new and old systems. There was a
larger development team supporting the old system that was actively bringing in
money for the company and paying all of our salaries. Another smaller team had
the marvellous job of learning about new technologies and write the
microservices that will be the new system that will save us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to be in both of those parts (supporting the legacy and help
with the rewrite) actually neither side is fun. Supporting the old application
had the pressure from the clients that they needed newer and newer features,
hunting bugs, dealing with downtimes. Reward part here was that when you have
done something you got instant feedback on your job. In the rewrite team you get
the pressure that everybody is waiting for this saviour system to come. They
expect to get a system that will solve all their problems, it will solve their
insomnia, it saves their marriage, they will be better parents and the new
system will even make them coffee in the morning. Also there is more developers
on the old system cranking out newer and newer features that the new system of
course will support! :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catching the ever growing features of the system we would like to replace is
just like Don Quichotte fighting with the windmills. You have very small chance
of winning. We actually tried to push back on the adoption of the new system
saying that its just not yet ready. But eventually we all agreed that it will
never be fully ready and at one point we need to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adaption-of-the-new-system&#34;&gt;Adaption of the new system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole team saw that we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to reach feature parity. For the
adoption we pick a client that had the least need of custom features and set
them up with the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of hick-ups, we were correcting a lot of bugs and mistakes that
came from the fact that the new system was also rushed. It didn&amp;rsquo;t become
spaghetti and thanks god we did write &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; tests - unlike the mentioned &amp;ldquo;temp
PoC&amp;rdquo; project that had zero tests. But eventually the new system was working, it
started to generate income for the company! To get to this point it took the
teams about 2 years!!! Also there was one big challenge still remaining: get all
the clients on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating the clients was the next stage of the rewrite. Clients shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need
to know about the changes we make in the background. They have a service that
they expect to get regardless if the backend is python or nodejs or assembly.
Interesting to note here that the service provided by the system relied on
historical data. That data was all in the old system! All that data had to be
converted and moved into the new system. This task was the one I actually ended
up enjoying maybe the most. Luckily the conversion wasn&amp;rsquo;t too complex and it was
interesting to see that we filled up the new databases through weeks of
carefully controlled migrations. Had to be careful not to over load the old
system. Then after all that: it worked! The system manage to show the same
reports to the users just like the old system! 2-3 years and we managed to get
to the same point as where we were before! :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-way&#34;&gt;Different way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temp PoC system was some sort of microservices architecture, sometimes we
were joking about it saying its a micro-monolith as 4 services were serving it.
The python legacy system was monolith. New system with the planning up front
without good experience with microservices was more towards a distributed
monolith with ~8 services serving the flow. We managed to change on this over
time (without starting from scratch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back of the decisions and what happened during the rewrite,
frustrations from both development and customer service teams, if I would have
to do the whole thing all over again, then would choose a different path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting again with a monolith system would look at the processes and would try
to move out small parts of the big service to a new microservice. Breaking down
the monolith bit by bit, so that all parts are constantly in use and being
validated. When we were doing the rewrite and testing we didn&amp;rsquo;t test the system
with high loads. Of course everything was working on low loads and amazing
developer computers, but when it went to production and came the load there were
lots of performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outro&#34;&gt;Outro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above case rewrite was a bad decision in my opinion, but still we managed
to get it working. There are cases where you have no other choice than starting
from scratch. In another post I&amp;rsquo;ll share a story where I did a full rewrite and
would do the same again in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Time travel and privacy</title>
			<link>https://szab.it/posts/time-travel-and-privacy/</link>
			<pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 18:39:00 +0100</pubDate>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://szab.it/posts/time-travel-and-privacy/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In December of 2020 I read some articles that made me want to go back in time
and use tools that I considered to be old. One of these articles was about the
productivity score by Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s O365, another was about how our phones betray
our trust (no surprise there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content behind the following three links that made me think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/26/microsoft-productivity-score-feature-criticised-workplace-surveillance&#34;&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/26/microsoft-productivity-score-feature-criticised-workplace-surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1331221942850949121&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1331221942850949121&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nrkbeta.no/2020/12/03/my-phone-was-spying-on-me-so-i-tracked-down-the-surveillants&#34;&gt;https://nrkbeta.no/2020/12/03/my-phone-was-spying-on-me-so-i-tracked-down-the-surveillants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mail-and-calendar&#34;&gt;Mail and Calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the article about O365 and that GSuite also has something similar
to that, I decided to go back to some kind of e-mail and calendar application
like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thunderbird.net/&#34;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.gnome.org/users/evolution/stable/&#34;&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I did use O365 via the browser before, it worked actually quite well didn&amp;rsquo;t
miss notifications and it overall provided a good interface. But using the
browser it also means that they can track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where is my mouse on the screen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the tab is actually active on my screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is on my screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typing and deleting and typing&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really waaaay too much information that I would feel comfortable to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must say it here: I&amp;rsquo;m not working for a company that collects such information
or would do actions based on such information. If the company would change and
go in this direction then I would have the choice to change my employer. Still I
would rather avoid providing even the possibility for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked through possible e-mail clients for GNU/Linux, there were two things that
are a must have for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no electron apps - don&amp;rsquo;t want to run a full browser with nodejs.. just don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be able to integrate with a calendar app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checked &lt;a href=&#34;https://bluemail.me/&#34;&gt;BlueMail&lt;/a&gt; briefly, but fall short on &lt;em&gt;a)&lt;/em&gt; being an electron app and &lt;em&gt;b)&lt;/em&gt; not
really maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at Thunderbird, it is still an okay with &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/lightning/&#34;&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; it can also satisfy
the calendar and it is still the default e-mail client in Ubuntu. While I don&amp;rsquo;t
use Ubuntu this will still keep maintainers motivated. However Thunderbird just
didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly I tried Evolution. After installing and setting it up, realized that I
used to use this client back when I started programming in 2010. Suddenly I&amp;rsquo;m
back in 2010, just have more grey hair than I used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With evolution it was a huge surprise to me that it works with O365 out of the
box, syncs calendar, contacts and even the todo items (if I would use them..
org-mode FTW!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: MS did admit this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good way and they are going to remove some low
level reporting. See their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/12/01/our-commitment-to-privacy-in-microsoft-productivity-score/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chat-applications&#34;&gt;Chat applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay this is bit of different topic than MS and phones tracking all of our
moves, but still related to the back in time theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving my e-mail and calendar to an app I managed to close two pinned tabs
from my browser and also managed to avoid using container tabs to be able to
login to my son&amp;rsquo;s and daughter&amp;rsquo;s O365 account (they are in lower grades of
primary school, so yes I do get to manage their accounts for when we&amp;rsquo;re in
remote tuition mode). With this closing of tabs I noticed that there are other
tabs that I also use they are just constantly pinned: whatsapp, facebook chat,
discord and sometimes gitter. So this provided a new challenge: can I find an
app to unite them all? Yes I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to use something that is just another browser, so went with
an old-old friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://pidgin.im/&#34;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt;. All the listed chat platforms have a plugin for it,
open source with a clean code base (didn&amp;rsquo;t review all of the code, but all the
files I visited was clean and relatively easy to understand), so very much
tempting to contribute. Best of all: Pidgin will only eat up ~70 Mb of memory -
opposed to gigabytes - and won&amp;rsquo;t send statistics about me to the facebook and
other data hoarder and dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mobile-front&#34;&gt;Mobile front&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this has triggered the privacy demon in me so started to look for
alternatives as well on mobile. First big hoarder to tackle: Google. The app
that is actual for me to look at is Google Photos. I loved this app as made
it very easy for me to share pictures with my wife or with anyone. Also could
access all the photos on my computer quickly and all is backed up and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All good things must come to an end at some point for me with Google Photos the
end meant that - understandably - they don&amp;rsquo;t provide free storage anymore. In
the past if you accepted that they re-compress the images with their algorithms,
then they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t count towards used data - so free and unlimited storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos are actually a long story for me, tried a lot of different solutions when
dealing with photos from my camera. Nothing work truly easily. A new motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apart of google - was that my wife started to make photos and videos with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the family DSLR. My wife isn&amp;rsquo;t tech savvy, so whatever solution I try next it
has to be seamless to her, other way she won&amp;rsquo;t use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the solution: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.truenas.com/download-tn-core/&#34;&gt;TrueNAS&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, decided to run my own storage at home. As you
may already guess I didn&amp;rsquo;t go with the most straightforward solution&amp;hellip; nah life
would be boring if we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make is pointlessly over complicated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for NAS my criteria was that I want to be able to extend it later when and if
I need more storage. For this you need more than just a two bay NAS, but rather
a 4 or 5 bay NAS. Now those bigger NAS setups a for me just ridiculously
expensive. Instead of spending big, decided to reuse my desktop PC from 2008 to
build a NAS using TrueNAS system. It is really an awesome setup for me, but
think I&amp;rsquo;ll write about that in a dedicated post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this TrueNAS setup I also installed &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextcloud.com/&#34;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;, this is able to replace both
Google Photos and Dropbox for me. Got a mobile app for it, easy enough to use
and there is also a Gnome integration for it. Apart of images and files it can
also serve as a calendar and contacts server (another stab at Google).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For larger files also configured NFS endpoints so that we can handle images from
the DSLR. NFS works surprisingly well with Darktable, it is able to read the
files quickly enough. If I would deal with images as a profession would probably
invest into a better network setup, but it works well enough via WiFi already.
Only secret is to keep &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.darktable.org/&#34;&gt;Darktable&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s SQLight database files on the local system,
having that over NFS renders the app uselessly slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the above setup working reliable and well, I&amp;rsquo;m really considering going
back to a privacy oriented Android setup on my phone as well, without all the
bloatware and mandatory google applications installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;news-sources&#34;&gt;News sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is still out there and still lives, I was surprised to find that most news
sites will have RSS feeds as well. With RSS again one can use a simple
application, even Evolution has RSS reader plugin and have all the news tracking
free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outro&#34;&gt;Outro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey with all those apps and different setups made me realize again that
we do share a lot of information about ourselves on the internet. In the
background we have no idea how they use all that data. The collected data
shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be connectable the person behind it, but in truth it can be. If you
don&amp;rsquo;t read all the three articles linked in the beginning, just read &lt;a href=&#34;https://nrkbeta.no/2020/12/03/my-phone-was-spying-on-me-so-i-tracked-down-the-surveillants/&#34;&gt;Martin
Gundersen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gets measured gets managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the data that we submit knowingly or not, voluntarily or not, will
enable companies to manage our actions. So now I&amp;rsquo;m back in 2010, running my own
server and using native application instead of browser based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>MongoDB deprecating &#34;count&#34;</title>
			<link>https://szab.it/posts/mongodb-deprecating-count/</link>
			<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 09:22:00 +0100</pubDate>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://szab.it/posts/mongodb-deprecating-count/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Prior warning: this post may turn into a rant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prologue&#34;&gt;Prologue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2019 at my company we have got an expected notice from our
MongoDB provider, Atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notice was about the usual pain that they do every now and then: force
upgrade for old versions. At that time we were running MongoDB v3.4 and so now
we got the notice to ensure that we have a driver that supports v3.6 as all the
clusters will be upgraded on the end of January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is well we look at these upgrades as a necessary evil, that causes pain in
short therm, but will bring benefits in the long run. The benefits with newer
MongoDB versions was the performance. We have tested some of our heavier
queries - with which we already have had issues in production - and behold they
become 10 times faster. (We were comparing MongoDB v3.4 with v4.2 at that time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought cool 10x the power! Lets do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have started our long journey of upgrades, tests, fixes and further
upgrades and tests, tears and cries, laughter and anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we were satisfied with the upgrade we have deployed our first services,
that was already in need of that performance boost. Cool we thought, surely we
gonna have some co-workers coming to us saying: Boys don&amp;rsquo;t know what has
happened, but the service is blazing fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, we were wrong! Surely the queries looked fast, but there was a tiny bit of
issue: some of our calls to the database started to timeout. Worst of it those
calls were actually fast previously. As an icing on the cake this didn&amp;rsquo;t come to
our attention straightaway, but only a week later, when another new service
wanted to sync data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once noted, we jumped into debugging. Looking at the database&amp;rsquo;s real time
operations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.currentOp/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.currentOp()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) we were seeing &lt;code&gt;aggregation&lt;/code&gt; calls on the biggest
collection being called. As we didn&amp;rsquo;t recall to have used such heavy
aggregations on that collection, we searched through our code base to find what
could issue this command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have managed to find a couple of places where we have used aggregation, but
none of them fitted the match that we seen in the operations list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually one team member suggested that that aggregation is the way MongoDB
does the count. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it at first, but then we have read a bit more
about the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.countDocuments/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;countDocuments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method that was &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;suggested method by the
documentation&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to use instead of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.countDocuments/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and turned out that it is indeed
slower as it is more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s JIRA ticket &lt;a href=&#34;https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-1638&#34;&gt;NODE-1638&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;count has been deprecated for a number of reasons. First, and foremost, the
existing count command could not be run within transactions, so an alternative
approach needed to be taken. Secondarily, the count command in most cases was
not accurate. We have replaced count with countDocuments and
estimatedDocumentCount. Please use estimatedDocumentCount for the performance
you are looking for, and parity with the original count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the reasons against &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not giving accurate results and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not transaction friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my point of view those two are not really reasons to deprecate a core
command, which think is quite needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;count-is-not-accurate&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is not accurate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay it isn&amp;rsquo;t, but honestly what was accurate in MongoDB before? Like with
iterating a &lt;code&gt;cursor&lt;/code&gt; (with mongoose &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;), you could easily miss documents or
see others twice in the process. Unless you set read preference to snapshot, but
even then if the process is long running and you have inserts in the mean time,
then you won&amp;rsquo;t see the new documents, so it is still a &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For processing all the data in the database, even the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist
when we started the process, we were using a practice where we sorted the &lt;code&gt;_id&lt;/code&gt; in
ascending order, retrieving data in batches and using the last _id in the list
with a greater than filter: &lt;code&gt;{ _id: { $gt: lastId } }&lt;/code&gt;. Like this we could
processes all the documents without duplicates and if there were new documents
created while the process run, no problem, still got them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in case of the count, so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a case where would have needed
pinpoint accuracy. I can imagine that there are case where one needs it, but
then just like with the streaming above there is a solution for it. The solution
in this case comes in aggregation and I&amp;rsquo;m sure that before the &lt;code&gt;countDocuments&lt;/code&gt;
command developers were using it to get the accurate count that they have
needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nice that now there is a method in mongo, that can give you the accurate
count, without fiddling around with aggregation. It is convenient for those who
need it. Still in my point it is not a reason to deprecate &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-transaction-safe&#34;&gt;Not transaction safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well okay. It isn&amp;rsquo;t. Don&amp;rsquo;t know, never tried it. As I tend to work with
microservices, I never missed or wanted to use transactions. It is hard to
implement across services. My preference for data consistency is to make
operations idempotent and so it is safe to put them into job queues, that
guarantee to run it at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to emphasize it: I do respect that in some cases transactions could be the
best or only solutions and it is nice that &lt;code&gt;countDocuments&lt;/code&gt; is transaction safe.
Just still not a reason to deprecate &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; has been marked as deprecated in MongoDB v4.0, it is still well and
alive in v4.2. Since the two replacement suggested to be used instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;countDocuments&lt;/code&gt; - way too slow for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;estimatedDocumentCount&lt;/code&gt; - cannot provide a query&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are both unsuitable for us, we have reverted all our calls to use the poor old
&lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; method and we have accepted that our terminal will be showing the
deprecation warnings for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now we hope that they won&amp;rsquo;t remove it or they will improve the performance
of the new &lt;code&gt;countDocuments&lt;/code&gt; method to be on pair with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finale&#34;&gt;Finale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this has indeed become a rant, but you have been warned. :D Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Bad dependencies and bad interface changes</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently one of my colleagues has shared his pain about a nodeJS package that we
use to zip files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His issue was that the library stopped generating the zip files and just hangs.
Eventually found, that in the project the package in question has been upgraded,
but with a small issue. The newer version has changed the interface and the same
method instead of returning the instance it returns a Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Archiver&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;finalize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;() {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;errored&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    })
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  })
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;};
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;source:&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/archiverjs/node-archiver/blob/dd7f10d/lib/core.js#L759-L792&#34;&gt;https://github.com/archiverjs/node-archiver/blob/dd7f10d/lib/core.js#L759-L792&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-interface-changes&#34;&gt;Bad interface changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The painful thing about the new code isn&amp;rsquo;t the fact that it has the same name
and returns something new, since the upgrade was not minor but &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that actually bad in my point of view, that it can return two
completely different things. Till there is an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; that is being triggered it
returns the instance of the class, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; once those are exhausted it returns a
&lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icing on the cake that in this case the instance that it returns is a stream,
that we were just piping, but now at some point it will turn in to a &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally it is a good rule of thumb that a method should always return with the
same type, no matter on the logic inside. (Unless your method is a type selector
or something like that :D )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the above code I could imagine that the original &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; could have
remained the same, always returning a stream. There could have been a new method
created that would give back a promise and also retaining backward
compatibility. E.g.: introducing an &lt;code&gt;asPromised&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Archiver&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;finalize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;() {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;();
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    });
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;_module&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;error&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;errored&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    });
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  });
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-dependencies&#34;&gt;Bad dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now over for the necessity of this npm package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This package is used in NodeJS, so we don&amp;rsquo;t send it to do magic on the
front-end, but we use it in a controlled environment: a NodeJS app running in a
Docker container wrapped in a Kubernetes pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the docker container we use GNU/Linux, so we can have other programs in
there as well, that can be found for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files that we zip are on an NFS drive, so we don&amp;rsquo;t need to stream it, we
know the location of the file as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes the idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we have linux &lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we have the files/folders accessible &lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we could have the &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; program on the system &lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in effect we could axe a third party npm package and use &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback&#34;&gt;child_process.exec&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options&#34;&gt;child_process.spawn&lt;/a&gt; method&amp;rsquo;s from NodeJS itself. The extra 3rd party in this
case would be the &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; program, but think it is safe to say that command is a
battle tested, fire hardened program. Which is not likely to cause issues or
change interface. For me an extra benefit of this approach, that we can offload
processing from the main app to a separate CPU thread &lt;em&gt;aaaand&lt;/em&gt; we can also use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/nice-invocation.html&#34;&gt;GNU&amp;rsquo;s nice utility&lt;/a&gt; to set the importance of the task. Like this we can also
ensure that the main app will always have enough CPU time to respond and the zip
command won&amp;rsquo;t eat it up from the app as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; is a reliable program that has and is being tested by millions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offload processing from the main app, so it can still serve other requests
without an issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use built-in NodeJS module that is not likely to change interface and also
tested by more than a lonely lib from npmjs.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good to think through as what is the goal and not just pick an npm package
off the shelf. The issue you&amp;rsquo;re facing has most likely already been solved.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Custom keyboard layout in GNU/Linux</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I generally like to use english keyboard layout for programming, makes it easier
to get to the special characters. However, since I&amp;rsquo;m a hungarian, from
time-to-time would like to use accented characters as well. E.g. &lt;code&gt;á&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;é&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ű&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ú&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;ő&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GNU/Linux to change keyboard layout isn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest to do. As far as I
remember (from about 10 years ago) in Windows there is a graphical app that
helps you with this. In GNU/Linux this is all via text files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps I&amp;rsquo;ve done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;add a new section in the &lt;code&gt;us&lt;/code&gt; symbol file - &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      partial alphanumeric_keys
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      xkb_symbols &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;euro-hu&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          include &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;us(basic)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          name&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Group1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;English (US, with Hun)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml&lt;/code&gt; - same way as &lt;code&gt;base.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst&lt;/code&gt; - same as &lt;code&gt;base.lst&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the system and the new keyboard layout should be available - for
gnome - in the &lt;em&gt;Regional &amp;amp; Language&lt;/em&gt; setting&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Input Sources&lt;/em&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to dig deeper in the topic there is a deeper documentatnion about
this over on a polish programmer&amp;rsquo;s site &lt;a href=&#34;https://michal.kosmulski.org/computing/articles/custom-keyboard-layouts-xkb.html&#34;&gt;Michał Kosmulski&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Creating custom
keyboard layouts for X11 using XKB&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also an option to make keyboard layout modifications with Xmodmap, but
I&amp;rsquo;ve had some bad experiences with it. Namely it was slow to load the config, so
rather do it via XKB. Possible that I was doing something bad with Xmodmap&amp;hellip;
but we will never no that now. :D&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Git global ignore file</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;the repo and you don&amp;rsquo;t even want it to be listed in the &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file of the
repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have multiple repositories, then there is a nice way to do it per user,
using the core.excludesFile config property of git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be set in your git install already (it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case for me, but
still worth to check it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git config --global --get core.excludesFile
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it returns path to a file, then just simply add your ignore pattern to that
file (just a todo.md line will do the trick, no need for absolute paths).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other way if the property isn&amp;rsquo;t set, you can set it to any file you would like
it to be:&lt;/p&gt;
